1
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:20,187
The north shore of the Hawaiian island of Oahu

2
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:25,317
is just over 2,400 miles from the west
coast of North America.

3
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:30,147
The ocean floor rises five miles to the
shores of what people call,

4
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,025
"The Seven Mile Miracle".

5
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:36,832
It's home to some of the most amazing
water and sand in the world.

6
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,619
What would it be like to be born on this island,

7
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,834
to grow up on these shores,

8
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,875
to witness this water everyday?

9
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,711
You're about to meet someone who did.

10
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,723
Here's John Florence and his birth certificate.

11
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
He was born in Honolulu, on October 18th 1992.

12
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,641
This is where John grew up,

13
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,693
this is John's office,

14
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,937
and this is a story about John John Florence.

15
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,994
John John Florence or whatever
isn't John John anymore.

16
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,544
He's just plain old John.

17
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:17,339
John has a tight-knit group of friends and
family living in the north shore of Oahu,

18
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,206
also known as paradise.

19
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,507
Like John, Kelly is a world-class surfer.

20
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,432
He's also John's neighbor and pretty nosy.

21
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,143
I'm thinking about maybe reporting
this illegal tree house

22
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,225
to the authorities so it'll get chopped down.

23
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,860
Another world-class surfer neighbor is Jamie.

24
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,493
He and John were best of friends growing up.

25
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,491
Jamie was an asshole.

26
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,833
He tied my board to the top of a coconut
tree in his yard one time,

27
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,829
and I was so bummed but Jamie was still
laughing the whole time.

28
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,291
Ouch! Rough neighborhood.

29
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,714
Don't let the palm trees fool you.

30
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,809
John surfs from dawn to dusk
often into the night,

31
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,729
everyday, ten hours a day.

32
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,017
Or so he claims.

33
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,850
One wonders when he has time to workout.

34
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,395
I do not workout, I just surf.

35
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,280
In 2014, John nabbed the number one
spot in the surfer poll

36
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,858
from Kelly Slater after 20 plus years.

37
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,284
How many time has Kelly won now? 22 times?

38
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,503
Like, this is old as I am, yeah.

39
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,997
Here's a wave breaking.

40
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,514
Here's a wave breaking John.

41
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:50,548
While he was recuperating, he picked up
a less dangerous hobby.

42
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,474
So, I originally started flying.

43
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,682
I still had my pilot's license long before
I had my driver's license.

44
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,774
So John was a world-class surfer

45
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,149
and could fly before he could drive.

46
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,018
Thank god you don't need a license to sail.

47
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,278
This...is not John's boat.

48
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,700
This is.

49
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,738
John also plays the guitar.

50
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,735
Ouch.

51
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,325
This is John's film storage
fridge in his dark room.

52
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,171
These are John's favorite cameras.

53
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,998
I'll say I use this one the most.

54
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:33,104
Already at 22 years old,

55
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:37,306
John has countless stamps to remind him of the
many places he has been to,

56
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,269
places that most only dream of.

57
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,649
Um, sometimes I look back on the passport and,
yeah,

58
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,106
it does make me reminiscence,
rem-remi...remember.

59
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,570
So props to you, John,

60
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,780
for living the dream, living our wildest dreams.

61
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,742
Pipe dreams, wet dreams, sweet dreams,
broken dreams.

62
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,155
For you, John, it's not a dream.

63
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,460
Dream on, John.

64
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,046
What else do we need?

65
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,466
Hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait,
hurry up and wait.

66
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,466
I wonder if the road's as bumpy
as it used to be.

67
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,506
Ah! There it is.

68
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,523
It's here.

69
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,676
- Holy shit.
-Enough size for it.

70
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,265
-Look at this one.
-Look at that one.

71
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,440
That's just for one.

72
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,898
-That's a nice one.
-Oh, damn it.

73
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:31,298
We meet in an hour of change and challenge,

74
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,256
in a decade of hope and fear,

75
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,299
in an age of both knowledge and ignorance.

76
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,353
The greater our knowledge increases,

77
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,983
the greater our ignorance unfolds.

78
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,646
...that all great and honorable actions

79
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,782
are accompanied with great difficulties,

80
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,370
and both must be enterprized and overcome

81
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,158
with admirable courage.

82
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:10,503
Many years ago, the great British explorer,
George Mallory,

83
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,962
who was to die on Mount Everest,

84
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,844
was asked why did he want to climb it.

85
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,260
He said, "Because it is there."

86
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,726
Well, space is there,

87
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,056
and we're going to climb it.

88
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,192
And the moon and the planets are there,

89
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,824
and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.

90
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,908
And, therefore, as we set sail,
we ask God's blessing

91
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:50,002
on the most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure

92
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,170
on which man has ever embarked.

93
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,039
Thank you.

94
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,064
Oh, look at the ocean.

95
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:58,225
Oh, imagine some inside cruising.

96
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,028
Oh, no hand.

97
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,396
Oh, my gosh.

98
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:03,775
See you later.

99
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,360
Should we go right here?

100
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,624
I'm sure it's pointless to
walk all the way down.

101
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:07,866
You end up right here anyway.

102
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:38,028
And so, for now, our time with
John comes to an end.

103
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,623
Any last words, John?

104
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,536
How about a wave?

105
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,789
Not that kinda wave, John.

106
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:50,764
That kind.

107
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,721
Check one, check two, check three, check four.

108
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,680
Check 55, or not.

109
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,561
Yeah, well, for, you know, for me...

110
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,678
-Oh, shit. Is it still going?
- Yeah.

111
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:39,645
Everything I associated with
surfing in the ocean,

112
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:43,016
was 100% to do with my brother.

113
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:47,985
He was my ultimate influence and I didn't
realize that until he was gone.

114
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:53,658
A lot of drive, insight for surfing
kinda went with him.

115
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,910
It took years for me to find that
love for surfing again.

116
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,044
It's through guys like John,

117
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:02,381
seeing how he's evolved from a kid to a man,
to what he's doing now...

118
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:06,758
That's what got me psyched, it made me wanna
reevaluate my whole surfing life.

119
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,131
I can't wait to see what's next.

120
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,510
Every session I go out with him, it's exciting,
it's already the future,

121
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,511
I see progressing with what he's doing.

122
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:40,273
For me, it's nice to be around that psyche,
that energy,

123
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:43,637
and how damn good he surfs.

124
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,105
I think that's why I think why he
is where he is at,

125
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:51,436
'cause the way he surfs and he draws these
lines that no one else draws.

126
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:54,235
It's explosive, it's wild, it's
unorthodox and it's...

127
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,369
It's John John.
